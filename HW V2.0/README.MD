I started working on a new concept for the Current Probe, with a new Current Sense resistor from Vishay VPG and new OP-AMPs with lower noise. 

The OPA1612 has a superior performace, and the sense resistor with kelvin connection can bring up the results to a **new level**.

I also wanna have this equipment laying around ready to be used, on V1.0 to turn off the current probe I had to get the batteries out, on V2.0 we have a switch.
