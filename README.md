# Oscilloscope Current Probe

This project is a current probe for characterizing the current consumption of Battery Based radio nodes or other embedded projects.

## Testing
Testing the Current Probe with one of the embedded projects that I'm working with. I was also trying to push the project to a maximum but the Slew Rate seems to be pretty good! I also tested it for DC current side-by-side with a HP 34401A, the deviation was pretty small, but the focus isn't DC, the focus is AC measurement of current.

For the future, I really wanna test it side-by-side with a N2820A to see how it performs.
