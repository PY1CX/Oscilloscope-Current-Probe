# Oscilloscope Current Probe

This project is a current probe for characterizing the current consumption of Battery Based radio nodes or other embedded projects.

## Testing
* Testing one of the embedded projects that I'm working with. I was also trying to push the project to a maximum but the Slew Rate seems to be pretty good!

For the future, I really wanna test it side-by-side with a N2820A to see how it performs.
